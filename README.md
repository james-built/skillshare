# Skillshare
A skill sharing &amp; project connection platform

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a platform for people with ideas & skills to connect with others who have the complementary skills or equipment
to realise their vision. Users will be able to blog and post updates on their projects to generate interest in them. Interested followers
can sign up as a project collaborator to  show what they can contribute and receive updates on events planned for the project.

## Project Status
This project is currently in active development, maker culture is continuing to grow and I hope to provide users both locally and abroad with a platform to connect with others who share their passion to create.
